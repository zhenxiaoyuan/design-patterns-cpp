## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

#### Builder
Feel used for ecs game engine
Refer to Rust ecs library [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy), maybe could refer cpp ecs library [entt](https://github.com/skypjack/entt)

#### Factories
Guess most of system used for Factories when creating classes, using inherit and polymorphic

#### Prototype
Guess used for data initialize, using serialization and deserialization

#### Singleton
Usually used for database connection
Refer to monostate
